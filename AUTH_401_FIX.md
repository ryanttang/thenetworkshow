# Authentication 401 Error Fix

## Problem Identified

The 401 Unauthorized error on the `/api/auth/callback/credentials` endpoint was caused by a **missing `secret` property** in the NextAuth configuration. NextAuth requires a secret to sign and verify JWT tokens, and without it, all authentication requests fail with 401 Unauthorized.

## Root Cause

In `src/lib/auth-config.ts`, the NextAuth configuration was missing the `secret` property:

```typescript
// BEFORE (causing 401 errors)
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  providers: [
    // ... providers
  ],
  // Missing secret property!
}
```

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Missing Secret Property

```typescript
// AFTER (fixed)
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,  // ✅ Added this line
  providers: [
    // ... providers
  ],
}
```

### 2. Added Environment Variable Validation

Added validation to ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is properly configured:

```typescript
// Check if NEXTAUTH_SECRET is available
if (!process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET) {
  console.error("NEXTAUTH_SECRET not configured");
  return null;
}
```

## Required Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in your deployment:

```bash
# Required for NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://thenetworkshow.vercel.app"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-super-secure-secret-key-here"

# Required for database authentication
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Script
Run the provided test script to verify the fix:

```bash
node test-auth-fix.js
```

### 2. Manual Testing
1. Visit `/api/debug/env` to check environment variables
2. Visit `/api/debug/nextauth` to check NextAuth configuration
3. Try signing in with demo credentials:
   - Email: `network_admin@example.com`
   - Password: `admin123!`

### 3. Browser Testing
1. Go to `/signin`
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Should redirect to `/dashboard` on success
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## Expected Results

After applying this fix:

- ✅ 401 Unauthorized errors should be resolved
- ✅ Authentication should work properly
- ✅ Users should be able to sign in successfully
- ✅ Sessions should be created and maintained

## Additional Notes

- The fix includes proper error handling for missing environment variables
- Debug logging is enabled to help troubleshoot any remaining issues
- Rate limiting is properly configured in middleware
- Security headers are properly set

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/auth-config.ts` - Added secret property and validation
2. `test-auth-fix.js` - Created test script for verification

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes to production
2. Verify environment variables are set in Vercel
3. Test authentication with demo accounts
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
